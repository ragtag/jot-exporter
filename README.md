# "jot" Exporter for Blender

"jot" is a non-photorealistic renderer developed at Princeton. This is a plug-in
for Blender that lets you export animation in a format that "jot" can read and
render.

See http://ragnarb.com/toolbox/jot-exporter-for-blender/ for documentation and
examples of what "jot" can do.
